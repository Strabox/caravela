## What is CARAVELA ?

CARAVELA is a prototype container cloud management/orchestrator platform, inspired by the Docker Swarm and Kubernetes orchestrators,
but with a fully decentralized, hence scalable architecture in order to be deployed in a Edge Computing environment.

This work is being developed in the context of my Masters Degree Thesis in Computer Science and Engineering @ Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico - Lisbon.

## Getting Started

This project is a standalone middleware to orchestrate Docker containers but it is highly inspired in the
Docker, Swarm and Kubernetes projects so the APIs and the CLI try to mimic a small subset of commands/features from
that platforms. So it is easily migrate container's deployment for a CARAVELA instance.

### Compile From Source

The Makefile in the project's root makes all the necessary actions to easily compile, develop, test and deploy.

The only *prerequisite* to use the basic functionality of makefile is a properly configured golang
environment/toolchain in the machine.
The golang version used in project: **1.9.4**.

There are two ways to build the project using the Makefile:
- Installing it in the golang environment
    1. `make install`
- Building the project in the Makefile directory (creating the executable in the directory)
    1. `make build`

### Create/Bootstrapping a CARAVELA instance

A CARAVELA instance can be bootstrapped with a single node. The command necessary is the following one where
<machine_ip> is the local ip address of the machine.

`caravela create <machine_ip>`

### Join a CARAVELA instance

To enter and start supplying/use resources, the following command gets the job done. It is only needed to replace
`<machine_ip>` with the local IP address of the machine and `<caravela_machine_ip>` with the IP address of a machine that is
already participating in a CARAVELA instance.

`caravela join <machine_ip> <caravela_machine_ip>`

### Run, Stop Containers and more

#### Run

`caravela run -cpus 2 -ram 256 <image>`

#### Stop
